# mark↓ Example: Basic workflow

This example demonstrates the minimum steps required to index Markdown snippets and render them with the mark↓ runtime. For context about the project and other frameworks, see the [monorepo overview](../../README.md).

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- Dependencies installed at the repository root (`npm install`)
- A manifest generated by the [CLI](../../packages/cli/README.md)

## Steps

1. **Author content** – Add Markdown files under `content/snippets`. Include YAML front matter for titles, tags, or custom metadata.
2. **Build the manifest** – From the repo root run:
   ```bash
   npx mark-down build content/snippets --outDir public/snippets
   ```
   Adjust `--outDir` to match your hosting setup.
3. **Serve the app** – Point your framework at the generated `snippets-index.json` and consume it via the [core runtime](../../packages/core/README.md) or the framework adapters for [Angular](../../packages/angular/README.md) and [React](../../packages/react/README.md).

## Customising

- Swap in your own snippet directory by updating the CLI command and any manifest paths in code.
- Extend the example with additional frameworks by installing the relevant adapter package.
- Use watch mode during development: `npx mark-down watch content/snippets`.

Refer back to the package READMEs for deeper API documentation and integration patterns.
