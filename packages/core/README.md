# mark↓ Core Runtime
*(published as `@mzebley/mark-down`)*

This package provides the framework-agnostic `SnippetClient` and supporting types used to fetch, cache, and render Markdown snippets at runtime. For a monorepo overview visit the [root README](../../README.md).

## Installation

Install the runtime alongside your application code:

```bash
npm install @mzebley/mark-down
```

You will also need a manifest file generated by the CLI. See the [CLI documentation](../cli/README.md) for steps to build `snippets-index.json`.

## Quick start

```ts
import { SnippetClient } from "@mzebley/mark-down";

const client = new SnippetClient({
  manifest: "/snippets-index.json",
});

const hero = await client.get("getting-started-welcome");
const components = await client.listByType("component");

console.log(hero?.title);
```

The client lazily loads the manifest when first needed, then fetches Markdown files on demand. Results are cached for the lifetime of the client instance.

## Client options

`SnippetClient` accepts a single configuration object:

- **`manifest`** (`string | ManifestEntry[] | () => Promise<ManifestEntry[]>`) – where to load the manifest. Pass a URL (default), an in-memory array, or an async factory for advanced scenarios.
- **`fetcher`** (`(input, init) => Promise<Response>`) – provide a custom fetch implementation. Useful for SSR environments or when using libraries like Axios.
- **`markdownRenderer`** – a `(markdown: string) => string | Promise<string>` function. Override to swap the default `marked` renderer for something like `remark` or a bespoke pipeline.
- **`resolveSnippetPath`** – map manifest entries to final URLs. Override when static assets live in a CDN or custom folder.

All options are optional except `manifest`.

## Working with snippets

Commonly used APIs:

- `client.get(slug)` – fetch a single snippet. Returns `Promise<Snippet | undefined>`.
- `client.list(filter)` – fetch snippets matching metadata filters.
- `client.listByType(type)` / `client.listByTag(tag)` – convenience helpers for common filter patterns.
- `client.search(query)` – fuzzy search titles, tags, and extra metadata.
- `client.clearCache()` – drop in-memory caches (useful during live reload scenarios).

Metadata is preserved exactly as declared in front matter. Custom keys are exposed through the `extra` property on `SnippetMeta`.

## SSR and custom fetchers

The runtime runs in browsers, Node.js, or edge runtimes. For server-side rendering:

```ts
import fetch from "node-fetch";
import { SnippetClient } from "@mzebley/mark-down";

const client = new SnippetClient({
  manifest: () => import("./snippets-index.json"),
  fetcher: (input, init) => fetch(input as string, init),
});
```

You can also pre-seed snippets by passing an array to `manifest` to avoid network requests entirely.

## Testing & type safety

- Use `SnippetMeta` and `Snippet` TypeScript types to describe props and state in your application.
- Mock the client by providing a manifest array or by stubbing the `fetcher` function.
- Run the workspace tests with `npm run test -- core` to exercise Vitest suites that cover caching, filtering, and Markdown conversion.
